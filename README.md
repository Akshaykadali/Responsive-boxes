Responsive Grid Layout Example
This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap's responsive grid system for creating dynamic layouts. It is designed for learning purposes, providing an easy way to understand how Bootstrap's grid classes work across different screen sizes.

📝 Description
The code utilizes Bootstrap's predefined grid classes to create a layout with six responsive blocks. These blocks adjust their size and arrangement based on the screen size, showcasing the flexibility and power of the Bootstrap framework.

🔧 Features
Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts for small, medium, large, and extra-large screen sizes using Bootstrap classes (col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl).
Bootstrap Integration: Uses Bootstrap's CSS and JS to simplify responsive styling and layout management.
Dynamic Grid System: Each block dynamically scales and repositions depending on the screen width.

🚀 How It Works
Grid System:

The layout is created using the .container and .row classes.
Six blocks (div.col-) are included, each assigned with responsive column classes (e.g., col-md-2, col-lg-3).
Responsive Adjustments:

The blocks span different column widths across various screen sizes (extra-small to extra-large).
Styling:

Bootstrap's bg-primary class gives the blocks a blue background for better visibility.


🖥️ Code Explanation
HTML Structure:
The layout is wrapped in a container div and divided into rows and columns using Bootstrap's grid classes.

Responsive Classes:
The column widths are defined for different breakpoints:

col-12: Full-width on extra-small screens.
col-sm-*: Defines behavior for small screens.
col-md-*, col-lg-*, col-xl-*: Adjusts for medium, large, and extra-large screens.
